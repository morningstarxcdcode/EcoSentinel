## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within EcoSentinel, please send an email to [morningstar.xcd@gmail.com](mailto:morningstar.xcd@gmail.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

### Security Response SLA
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Response within 2 hours, patch within 24 hours
- **High vulnerabilities**: Response within 8 hours, patch within 72 hours
- **Medium/Low vulnerabilities**: Response within 24 hours, patch within 7 days

### Bug Bounty Program
We offer rewards for security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:
- Critical: $500-$2000
- High: $250-$500
- Medium: $100-$250
- Low: $50-$100

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

- All sensitive environmental data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- API keys and credentials are stored securely using environment variables
- Database connections use SSL/TLS encryption
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) for all TLS connections
- Zero-knowledge architecture for sensitive user data
- Regular encryption key rotation (every 90 days)
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for critical cryptographic operations

### Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Just-in-time (JIT) access for privileged operations
- Biometric authentication for high-security operations
- Session management with automatic timeout
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authorization

### Monitoring

- Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- Audit logs for all administrative actions
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with custom rules
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration
- Continuous security posture assessment

## Best Practices for Contributors

1. Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
2. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
4. Keep dependencies updated regularly
5. Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Immediately contact the development team
2. Document the incident details
3. Implement temporary mitigations if possible
4. Await further instructions from the security team
